# V0.1 - 11/11/25 - Skeleton FastAPI, OpenRouter API communication

- Skeleton template for FastAPI applications added (`app.py`, `templates/index.html`)
- OpenRouter API communication script added
    - NOTE: If running the application locally, running this script with your API key before the main application is a good idea to catch any problems with communicating with OpenRouter

# V0.2 - 11/17/25 - Model Schema

- Model schema built in `models.py`
- Pydantic models to mirror these with type constraints coming soon
